_...dary!_ LEGENDARY! Hello to my fans. For all of you who thought that I finished my previous post with _legen..._, I didn't. So if that thought crossed your mind even for a second I won. You hear me __I WON__. There's a new serif in town; his name is Albert and he good at his job. Where did you think this would go? I am in control - _You_ have no power here. You lost it all when you followed that link. You don't know me.

It's been such a long time since the last time I did this. Back then Donald Trump running for president was a joke. Well... Who's laughing now? I guess it _is_ still a joke somehow; one of the sad ones. The ones that make people smile out of sympathy. It's just too awkward I guess.

So I decided to write again. Actually I have been writing stuff here an there so now I should be able to compile some posts faster, which will not happen in the end. Reading back to what I wrote half a year ago, it feels very outdated and barely _me_, so I decided to let them live in the digital notebooks unpublished, only for me and Google to read :).

Having published and unpublished work feels cool I ain't gon' lie. To make the decision that some stuff, that you worked on once, are not worthy to _leave and live_. I am one step closer to Damien Rice. You know, if you exclude the parts where he's actually talented and famous and important and stuff. Maybe we'll get there. Someday.

I made _this_. I refer to my blog, the _Porcelain Throne Waterfalls_. It's more of a project but also a great excuse when people ask me about this blog. See for yourself:

_I really wanted to make a static website using Jekyll and host it on Github Pages. Yes this is hosted on a public github repository that you can visit and check out. Interesting huh?_

Here, nobody noticed my ego hiding behind my developer's shoulders.
