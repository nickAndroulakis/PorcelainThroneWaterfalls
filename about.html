Shithole. That's the word that best describes the internet for me. It's a big, endless, compilation of poop. And for me to contribute, I have to use the most accessible portal to this ecosystem; a toilet.

Hence, this is my _porcelain throne_. See my thoughts flow down like _waterfalls_, as I push the button, so they can meet their endgame.

Those words that once were inside me, will now have their own lifetime. They left the floor - they left me empty - till the next ones will take their place in my head. And from there, once more, down the throne.
Enjoy reading my shit.
