Yes pipol, I will be doing this thingie, my sister does. I even copied the title just to salute her style. It’s not personal, Nassia. It’s strictly business #GodfatherQuotes. Oh, there's no going back now #copyCat #noRegrets

Now that I leave Greece, I get to, finally, post in english. I can always claim that I have to do it from now on, cause of my european friends, hiding the fact, I'm just a poser and a hipster, who enjoys typing in English.

I guess sharing music on social media is like sharing thoughts (well, #noShitSherlock). There will always be those who just get it and, of course, those who don't. I actually enjoy listening sad music; in a way sad music balances me out. Let's just say, pretty often "my happy is too loud" and I need to level it down xD. Point is that if you really care of what people will think of your posts, then you shouldn't post in the first place. No, it's not some heart-opening to strangers (sorry, facebook friends) ;it's some taste-sharing (you're welcome, facebook friends). After all, #sharingIsCaring.

But, seriously, take a moment to look at the dark sky at night. Now, take a deep breath and start counting all those fucks that I give, orbiting our planet just like the Moon.

So there's this imaginary place near Baghdad, I will be visiting from time to time, called Donethat. Of course there's Fuckthat just around the corner too. Damn, greek jokes sound way much cooler in greek #duh. However, I get to use #duh now, so that's a trade I'm, kinda, okay with B .

___
And I will quote one of my sisters(I'm not throwing people under the bus) at this point: "How does gPhotos categorize my photos as food or flowers? Is there an employee, whose job is to do so?" :D :D. #howStuffWorks #blackMagic

Everybody should know that half of my jokes are bad on purpose. -yeah ok, I like half of my bad jokes, so the other half of them. A quarter- I strongly believe in maintaining the balance in things, -the yings and the yangs, you feel me?- and I, really, would not like a black hole in my living room... and there's another one! #Yay :/

___
To be honest, that last one made me laugh. -Shame, shame, shame... *bell dings* #loopForever.

There is a lot of selfishness involved in expecting people to laugh at your jokes. My rule of thumb for jokes goes like this: You should just go ahead and say anything -literally anything- that would make you laugh. Τhat being said, you should always amuse yourself with your jokes. They may be dumb. They may be pathetic excuses for jokes, but if that makes you happier, even for a moment, it should be ok. Now if you're good enough, at times, you will make other people around you smile too. But, to be fair, that does not mean you are always funny. It means you are social though, and good for you kid. Good for you. #johnOliverStyle

In case you want to give feedback on this thingie, I give you this riddle to solve. "What has two thumbs and doesn't give a crap?" Well, it's not Sir Jaime Lannister, that's for sure. #spoilerAlert

Will there be an easter egg in this post? I don't know #obviousLie. In case there is, though, the code to find it should be this one: 12~0~28~27~0~0~28~0~0~26~0. This one is easy. You are smart kids, you'll figure it out. #nextLevel.

tl;dr -> Read the damn thing, Jesus -it's not water. you can't just go over it-. Same thing applies to everyone, not just the #randomJesusOnMyFriendlist.

Prpp out \m/
