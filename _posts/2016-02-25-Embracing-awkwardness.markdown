1. Embracing awkwardness like that time in a well-known fast food restaurant. GO, FLASHBACK! So, I am standing in front of the counter, waiting for my order. It is important to state that I had a to-go order; not to stay. Just for the record. I am really distracted at the moment, I don't remember why. Aghh, I have been waiting for so long; it seems plastic food takes forever to be prepared. So I am in my happy place, singing to myself and observing people "dancing" to the music in my head #weird. As I am in front of the line, I have ahead of me disks with orders to-stay, being assembled. You know how it is; Coke comes first, the fries second while a burger or something will complete the meal. Did I say I am really distracted? I am hungry too, but that's heavily implied. So I casually... grab a fried potato and put it in my mouth. Oh well :/. I realize what I just did and I freeze, along with the music in my head. I just took a fry from a another order #omgOmgOmg.

"Brain a little help, do you mind?"
"I do mind ^^"
"Oh punny mr Brain... BEHAVE SLAVE"
"Okay, okay. You don't have to be like that... Here's my advice. Chew"
"Chew?"
"Ye just go with the flow, chew your potato. I mean it's not your potato but whatever, you are not planning to spit it back into the bowl, are you?"
"I guess you're right... There goes nothing!"

And I hit unpause on my imaginary boombox. ~But I'm a creeeeeeep! I'm a weirdooooooo... WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HEEEEREEEE; I DON'T BELOOOONG HEEERE~ xD

2. In January, Geneva area is pretty dead, outdoors activities wise. So everybody does the one thing available; snowfalling. You may have heard it before by other names, such as "le snowboard" or "le ski", but do not be fooled! It's snowfalling. This is an interesting procedure where the amount of physical pain will clear your head from work stuff. Actually the pain is so real, it helps with stress issues. So the concept is you go on weekends. Depending on how much time you invest in snowfalling, you will get rewarded with enough pain throughout the work-week. The muscle pain may fade away by Wednesday or Thursday, but your spirit will still be crushed just in the thought of upcoming snowfalling on the slopes. This will definitely distract you from any unimportant stuff. Oh, and it was such a stress-free January ;).

3. In general, I am all for using expressions, keeping your writing, as well as your speech, interesting and diverse, however you should always use your brain. It is really important, you guys. "Use or lose it", as my English teacher used to say. So I was with some fellow cernies, right after lunch, when one kindly asked "Would anyone fancy some coffee?". Some of us nodded positively while others declined politely. And then there was this guy who said "Hmm coffee? Nah, it is not my cup of tea...". Well, duh? No no. Duh doesn't even come close to describe this. Trust me, facebook friends, this was not a troll. I was so intrigued, I had to ask. "So Blahblah" - Blahblah is not a real name, I should tell you, I made this one up; Isn't that creative? - "What IS your cup of tea?". The answer left me hanging. "Hot chocolate!" #facepalm

4. #realTalk. Going through stuff can take some time, but hey, time is all we got. Going through stuff alone, though, is an obstacle we can actually tackle. Thing is that most of us will not even anticipate the problem; we think we can take it. Every now and then life will troll us, tossing people in our way willing to help us out, but we are too "strong" to accept a hand. Stubborn is the word here. No one should ever go solo through anything. Even Hans had Chewbacca. All we need to solve most of our concerns is perspective! We need to embrace them and discuss them. A great song states that together sadness is half and happiness is double. And even if I heavily doubt that you can unload heartbreak and pain on others, I can assure you that you can accelerate the sad part. Then we can only hope, the next part is a happy one. So put a smile on that beautiful face of yours, go grab a friend and have a beer or two. Another song says "Use somebody". Oh, where there's a will, there's a way! I will not judge :)

5. Reporting live from 07D -shock, I'm on a plane- and I'm about to, seriously, creep out. "Brain, are you on board?"
"I mean, technically, you are on a plane and I'm stuck with you for life, so yes!"
"Not a good time to troll mr Brain. Help me out brah!"
"l am not your brah, I am literally in your head, you dumbass. Anyhow, weirdo, you may proceed..."

Now that I have the brains on my side imma gonna do the creep. I will just write the following: Hello passenger on my right. Yes, I can see your "Do not disturb" headphones, however, this is happening! You sit there all by yourself waiting. What are you waiting for? We should communicate! There is a high chance you are reading this. Is it though appropriate to read what other people write? And who is to blame if you do? I would blame your brain probably, but this is a long discussion. We should use speech; this ancient technique that we conquered as species! Come oooon neighbor. This flight is boring already, how worse can it get? Let me check my creep-o-meter... Yep, it's over 9000. Fight back with words stranger!

6. Talking myself into studying these days could be easier, one would say. Let's just say, I am pretty difficult in that respect. Assuming a random scenario, I have exams coming up for course "F". I need to prepare to take the exam by the ancient method of "studying"; a case so unlikely in my head, I would rather castrate myself. I may be in denial, however I have to pull through this time. We don't want to fail the F course, of course. So I take the first steps; I open the respective pdfs on my desktop, sit straight in my chair and -you know- start reading. Not a minute later, my body is shaping letters on the chair, but the weird ones; Now, I am an "S", now a "Z" or even a "W". Ok I agreed to study, facebook friends, not to dislocate my back. Then I have this great idea! YES! It was right there, it was so obvious; The couch. I can study from the couch. Taking the steps again; adjusting. Zoom in as needed, drag out my mouse and sit on the couch. This is so comfy, this is justice for my back. What harm would it be if I lean a little bit. Just a little bit to the arm of the couch. This could actually work! I am reading another page... Oh this couch is sooo nice, but... But putting my weight on my arm is distracting my blood flow, making it "heavy". You know what? I should lay down completely to solve this problem. So I do, and I go on to read another page. And I scroll... And I scroll... And I scroll... And this is how I fight insomnia xD.
